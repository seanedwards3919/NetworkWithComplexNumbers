This is a C library that allows a user to create and run a neural network for numerical data. It is written in C, and uniquely, it supports complex numbers to be used in calculations and data. 

While this can be currently built on Linux, it's mostly being written as an experiment and a way to familiarize myself with larger projects and C. It is currently usable as a full neural network, though it is a work in progress.
