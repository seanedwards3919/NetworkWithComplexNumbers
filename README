This is a C program (and hopefully a library eventually) that allows a user to create and run a neural network for numerical data. It is written in C, and uniquely, it supports complex numbers to be used in calculations and data. 

This is not currently meant for full use. It's being written as an experiment and a way to familiarize myself with larger projects and C. It is currently not usable as a full neural network, and is a work in progress.
