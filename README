This is a C program (and hopefully a library eventually) that allows a user to create and run a neural network for numerical data. It is written in C, and uniquely, it supports complex numbers to be used in calculations and data. 

This is not meant for professional use. It's being written as an experiment and a way for the author to familiarize himself with larger projects and C. It is currently not usable as anything other than a test suite, and is a work in progress.
